                <p>Hi! My name is Jordan and I am the President of our board at Four Angels. I live in Laramie with 
                    my husband, our four daughters, and our dogs. I started Four Angels after my husband and 
                    I experienced several losses. I wanted a way to turn our grief into something meaningful to 
                    others who have experienced pregnancy loss. </p>

                <p>My name is Nikki McConnell. My husband, Sean and I have two wonderful children, Addilyn and 
                    Clive. We lived in Laramie for 11 years before moving to Wisconsin to help with a church 
                    revitalization. As a former Labor and Delivery nurse I had the honor of walking with families 
                    through both their best and worst days.</p>

                <p>Hi! My name is Sarah. I am a mom of three beautiful girls (two bio one bonus), and a daycare 
                    owner. A few years ago I suffered a missed miscarriage and it was one of the hardest times 
                    in my life. Because of this experience I decided that I wanted to help Jordan out with Four 
                    Angels non-profit in order to support other women who have had a miscarriage.</p>

                <p>Hi all! My name is Randi and I live in Laramie with my husband on a small farm. We have horses, 
                    chickens, dogs, and cats so my time is always full! I am a member at large on the board for Four Angels and take 
                    pride in knowing that I am helping to provide support and resources to those who have experienced 
                    loss as I personally know the pain they are experiencing. </p>

                <p>I live in wonderful Laramie, Wyoming, and I’m honored to be a part of such a powerful group. 
                    I’ve been blessed with two amazing children and didn’t have the hardship of my own loss. But 
                    having multiple friends who have had personal losses, I want to be a voice for those who stand 
                    with our friends, help others who witness their friends’ grief, and advocate for those who want to help but don’t quite know how.</p>
